The objective of the project is to acquire vital signs reliably and continuously using compact, ultra wearable, non-invasive, unobtrusive modular wireless medical grade sensors that will aid training of a learning system to predict abnormalities associated with certain specific activities and fall events. The acquired multi-parameter vital signs combined with alarms from the prediction engine will help in effective diagnosis and rapid clinical intervention. It will also provide quantitative data for further research and contextual assessment of changes in parameters surrounding certain events.

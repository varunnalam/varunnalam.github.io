Developed an elevated walkway which included concpetualization, design and development of an elevated structure into which a robotic platform can be recessed. The project involved designing the safety harness system which was then developed in collaboration with Mobility Research Inc, Tempe. The walkway is integrated with the robotic platform, a motion capture system and an EMG sensor system for neuromuscular analysis.

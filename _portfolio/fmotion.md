The project aims at development of a device which can analyze and replicate Human motion on different robotic devices. The system uses contact based sensors which gather kinematic of human arm and transmit it to a central processor. The arm data is then adapted to the dynamics of the robot to produce a seamless control of the robot. The main motivation behind the project was to devise more intuitive control strategies for Human Robot Interaction , increasing the utlization of robots in fields of medicine and construction to improve safety and quality of life.

The project entailed data acquision from the sensor sleeve, signal processing and develoment of forward and inverse kinematics for different robotic arms.

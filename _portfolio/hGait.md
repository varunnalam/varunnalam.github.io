The project aims at aiding the rehabilitation of victims of lower limb disorders and injuries.The device senses and displays the contact points of the foot of the person during postural balance ,walking and other lower limb functions.The contact points are then displayedon visual feedback which can then be used to identify abnormal behaviors. A learning algorithm is developed that can compare duty cycles of each contact point for healthy and affected populations for data driven diagnosis.

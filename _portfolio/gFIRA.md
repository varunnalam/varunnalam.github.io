[FIRA](http://www.firaworldcup.org/VisitorPages/default.aspx?itemid=3) is an international autonomous robosoccer competition where multi agent robotic systems compete with other teams over a game of soccer. The robots engage in real time decision making and cooperation based on data obtained from real time vision input of the arena. As the team leader, I represented IIT Madras at Kuala Lumpur in 2013 and Led a Team of 11 members.I also coordinated work among different departments such as Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, Electronics& communication ,Control and Mechanical Systems while my primary responsibilities include design of control system , communication protocols and embedded system for the robots.

THe system has been designed to address the growing number of fatalities in road accidents. The system integrates data from a GPS,GSM, IMU and the speedometer and ensure that none of the conditions leading to an accident occur.The main task of the system is to ensure that a safe vehicle speed is observed by using the GPS and the speedometer. The speed limit at a location is dynamically adjusted based on local weather and time using a fuzzy algorithm. Additinally, the system notifies emergency services with relevant location information in case of an accident.

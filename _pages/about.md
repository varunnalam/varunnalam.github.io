I am a PhD candidate at [Neuromuscular Controls and Human Robotics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/asuneurorobotics) at ASU, working under the guidance of Dr.Hyunglae Lee. My research primarily focuses on developing robotic rehabilitation methods for patients suffering from Neurological diseases such as Stroke and Multiple Sclerosis by analyzing and quantifying the neuromusclar model of the human ankle. 

Prior to my work in rehabilitation, I was developing embedded systems and controls for Surgical Robots at [Biorobotics Lab, NUS](https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/biorobotics/Biorobotics+Lab) in addition to developing health monitoring systems for elderly in Singapore. I have received my Bachelors and Masters in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras, where I have led the institute robotics teams in [Robocon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon) (2011) and [FIRA](http://www.firaworldcup.org/VisitorPages/default.aspx?itemid=3) (2012-13).

Over the last 10 years, I have been working in various fields of robotics such as Mobile robots, Multi-agent systems, Human-Robot Interaction, Industrial Robots, Surgical robots and Rehabilitation robotics focusing on Embedded systems and Controls. My exposure to the state of art in Embedded systems and Control along with the skills developed as part of my curriculum in Mechanical Engineering helped me in developing a well rounded skillset required for Design, Development and Control of Robotic systems for a wide range of applications. 

I am always looking for opportunities where I can combine my research accumen with my entreprenurial spirit to solve real world problems using Robotics.

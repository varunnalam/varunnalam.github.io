I am a PhD candidate at [Neuromuscular Controls and Human Robotics Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/asuneurorobotics/) at ASU. My research primarily focuses on developing robotic rehabilitation methods for patients suffering from Neurological diseases such as Stroke and Multiple Sclerosis by analyzing and quantifying the neuromusclar model of the human ankle. Prior to my work in rehabilitation, I was developing embedded systems and controls for Surgical Robots at [Biorobotics Lab, NUS](https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/display/biorobotics/Biorobotics+Lab). I have received my Bachelors and Masters in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras, where I have led the institute robotics teams in [Robocon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon) (2011) and [FIRA](http://www.firaworldcup.org/VisitorPages/default.aspx?itemid=3) (2012-13).
